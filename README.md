# Code Quiz

This project uses web API methods to generate a 10 question quiz for the user to complete. This quiz also has a timer, which counts down as soon as the user begins,
and decreases by 10 for every wrong answer. Once the quiz is done, the final score is whatever time is left on the timer. The user then has the choice to add this to a highscore table.

## To-Do List

* Make it so the button starts quiz by adding text elements to the question and answer, and also starts timer, and also hides start quiz button
* Make it so that the wrong answer deducts 10s from timer
* make it so that the correct answer loads the next question
* After 5 question, store timer data and prompt user to enter form
* Set up high-score table (see second set of pseudocode)
