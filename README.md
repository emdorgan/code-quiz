# Code Quiz

This project uses web API methods to generate a 5 question quiz for the user to complete. This quiz also has a timer, which counts down as soon as the user begins,
and decreases by 10 for every wrong answer. Once the quiz is done, the final score is whatever time is left on the timer. The user then has the choice to add this to a highscore table.

## To-Do List

* After 5 question, store timer data and prompt user to enter form
* Set up high-score table (see second set of pseudocode)

## Possible Improvements

* randomize the multiple choice answers (given my code setup, this shouldn't be hard)

## Getting Started

Just press the start quiz button to start the challenge!
